### üîß API Endpoints Used
```javascript

- Frontend UI adapts based on user role

### Data Filtering
- API responses filtered by user's assigned scope
- UI components show/hide based on permissions
- Real-time data updates respect access controls

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of unauthorized access attempts
- User-friendly error messages for permission issues
- Automatic token refresh and logout on auth failures

All screens now use real API data with proper role-based access control!
