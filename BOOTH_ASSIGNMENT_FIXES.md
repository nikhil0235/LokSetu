# Booth Assignment and Booth Boy Creation Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. BoothAssignmentScreen Issues
- **Problem**: Using mock data instead of real API calls
- **Solution**: 
  - Created `booth.service.js` for API calls
  - Replaced mock data with real API integration
  - Added proper loading states
  - Implemented real booth assignment functionality

### 2. CreateBoothBoyScreen Issues
- **Problem**: Hardcoded test data in form initialization
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed hardcoded test values
  - Set empty initial form state for production use
  - Removed unused loading state variable

### 3. BoothSelectionScreen Issues
- **Problem**: Console.log referencing undefined variable and hardcoded API parameters
- **Solution**:
  - Fixed console.log reference error
  - Used dynamic state values instead of hardcoded parameters

### 4. AdminDashboardScreen Navigation Issues
- **Problem**: Missing navigation to booth assignment and booth boy creation screens
- **Solution**:
  - Added proper imports for CreateBoothBoyScreen and BoothAssignmentScreen
  - Implemented navigation handling for both screens

### 5. API Configuration Updates
- **Problem**: Missing booth assignment endpoints
- **Solution**:
  - Added BOOTH_ASSIGNMENTS endpoints to API configuration
  - Created booth service for centralized API calls
